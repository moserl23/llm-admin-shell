Summary of checks
- HTTP: http/https to nextcloud.local return 200 OK (login) after 302 redirect; /status.php returns 200.
- Apache: active; no 500s in access log; Nextcloud vhost error log shows no recent errors.
- Nextcloud: installed, not in maintenance (occ status OK).
- PHP-FPM is inactive, but Apache is using mod_php (mpm_prefork + php_module), so that’s expected here.

Conclusion
- I cannot reproduce an HTTP 500 now; the site appears healthy.

Notes and optional follow-ups
- Nextcloud log shows “dirty table reads” exceptions from notifications. Not fatal, but keep an eye on DB load/transactions.
- If users previously saw a 500, capture it next time:
  - Immediately check Apache error log: tail -n 100 /var/log/apache2/nextcloud.local-error.log
  - Note timestamp and correlate with: grep ' 500 ' /var/log/apache2/nextcloud.local-access.log
  - Check Nextcloud app log around that time: tail -n 200 /var/www/nextcloud/data/nextcloud.log
- Consider enabling APCu/Redis if not already for stability/performance, and ensure cron is set to system cron rather than AJAX.
