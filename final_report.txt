The administrator investigated persistent Nextcloud PHP fatal errors related to memcache configuration
 Key findings and actions:

- Nextcloud's config
php references Redis and APCu memcache modules for caching and locking

- Apache error logs showed fatal errors indicating Redis and APCu PHP modules were either missing, disabled, or causing class redeclaration conflicts

- Attempts to switch memcache
local and memcache
locking settings in config
php to use APCu and then ArrayCache failed, resulting in HTTP 500 errors and continued memcache-related fatal errors

- PHP Redis and APCu modules were present in the system's PHP conf
d directory but apparently not properly enabled or conflicting

- Additional errors included denied access to /var/www/nextcloud/data/
ncdata and a missing script /var/www/nextcloud/php_redis_check
php

- Multiple sed commands were used to update memcache settings in config
php to '\\OC\\Memcache\\ArrayCache', but errors persisted

- HTTP status checks showed initial 302 redirects followed by successful 200 responses after some config changes, but fatal errors remained in logs


Summary: Nextcloud's memcache configuration is broken due to missing, disabled, or conflicting PHP Redis and APCu modules, causing fatal PHP errors and caching failures despite config adjustments
