The system administrator verified that the Apache2 service is active and running. Analysis of the Nextcloud Apache error logs revealed repeated PHP fatal errors related to memcache configuration:

- Errors indicate that the Redis (OC\Memcache\Redis) and APCu (OC\Memcache\APCu) memcache modules are reported as unavailable for local cache, suggesting misconfiguration or missing PHP extensions.
- PHP fatal errors include class redeclaration issues for OC\Memcache\APCu, occurring in `/var/www/nextcloud/lib/private/Memcache/Factory.php` (line 81) and `APCu.php` (line 12).
- Despite these errors, PHP modules for apcu and redis are installed and enabled, confirmed by `php -m` and `php -i` outputs.
- Nextcloud configuration shows APCu is set as the local memcache module.
- The Nextcloud maintenance repair command completed successfully without major issues.

In summary, the main problem is a conflict or misconfiguration involving the APCu and Redis PHP memcache modules causing fatal errors in Nextcloud, despite the required PHP extensions being installed and enabled.
