Summary of the terminal session:

- HTTP requests to http://127.0.0.1/ with Host header "nextcloud.local" consistently returned HTTP status 302 (Found), indicating redirection.
- The Apache server version is 2.4.58 on Ubuntu.
- The HTTP response headers include multiple Set-Cookie directives and a Location header redirecting to the Nextcloud login page.
- Nextcloud configuration (/var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php) includes:
  - Trusted domains: "nextcloud.local" and "nextclouds.local"
  - Overwrite CLI URL set to "http://nextcloud.local"
  - Data directory at /var/www/nextcloud/data
  - Database: MySQL on localhost with user "nextcloud"
  - Redis caching configured on 127.0.0.1:6379
  - Nextcloud version 31.0.7.1 installed and not in maintenance mode
- Nextcloud logs show:
  - Multiple PHP deprecation warnings related to the richdocuments app (passing null to json_decode)
  - RuntimeExceptions triggered by the bruteforce app due to lazy loading of AppConfig values
  - Several admin_audit console commands executed, including disabling the "bruteforcesettings" app, which was successfully disabled
- The Nextcloud instance is operational but redirects all HTTP requests to the login page, as expected for unauthenticated access.

No critical errors preventing Nextcloud operation were observed, but some deprecated PHP usage and app-related exceptions are present in logs.
