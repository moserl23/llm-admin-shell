Summary of the troubleshooting and resolution steps for Nextcloud service issues:

- The local Apache web server responded correctly with HTTP 200 OK.
- Nextcloud's Apache error log was empty; however, the Nextcloud occ log showed a database connection error:  
  `access denied for user 'USER_OF_DB'@'localhost'`.
- MariaDB was running, but its logs contained repeated access denied warnings for the same database user.
- The Nextcloud config.php specified database user 'USER_OF_DB' with password 'change_this'.
- Attempts to connect to MariaDB using these credentials failed with access denied error 1698.
- Querying MariaDB's mysql.user table revealed no existing user 'USER_OF_DB'@'localhost'.
- The administrator created the MariaDB user 'USER_OF_DB'@'localhost' with password 'change_this' and granted all privileges on the Nextcloud database.
- Running Nextcloud's maintenance repair command then failed due to Redis permission denied errors.
- Redis was configured to use a Unix socket at `/var/run/redis/redis-server.sock` owned by user and group 'redis' with permissions `srwxrwx---`.
- The web server user `www-data` was not in the 'redis' group, preventing access to the Redis socket.
- The administrator added `www-data` to the 'redis' group and restarted Apache and Redis services.
- Despite this, the Redis socket permissions remained restrictive (`srwxrwx--- redis:redis`), causing continued permission denied errors during Nextcloud maintenance commands.
- Apache and Redis services were confirmed running; Apache continued to serve HTTP 200 OK responses.
- The main issues identified were:  
  1. Missing MariaDB user for Nextcloud causing database connection failures.  
  2. Redis socket permissions preventing Nextcloud from accessing Redis caching, resulting in permission denied errors.

No final resolution for the Redis permission issue was shown; further adjustment of Redis socket permissions or group membership is implied to be necessary.
