===== STEPS =====
--- Step 1 ---Obs:
PLAN_HYPOTHESES:
Nextcloud is not responding. Possible causes include: 1) Apache2 web server is down or misconfigured; 2) PHP-FPM or PHP is malfunctioning; 3) Database (MySQL/MariaDB) is down or unreachable; 4) Nextcloud is in maintenance mode; 5) Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk); 6) Network issues. I will rank these based on likelihood and impact.
--- Step 2 ---Obs:
PLAN_EVALUATE:
The most probable hypothesis is that the Apache2 web server is down or misconfigured, as it is the primary entry point for Nextcloud. If Apache is not running or has a configuration error, Nextcloud will not respond at all. This is more likely than PHP or database issues, which typically result in error messages rather than a total lack of response. Maintenance mode would show a specific message, and resource exhaustion or network issues are less common but possible.
--- Step 3 ---Obs:
PLAN_ACTIONS:
1) Check if Apache2 service is running and healthy. 2) Review the Apache error log for recent errors. 3) If Apache is down or errors are found, restart/reload Apache2. 4) If Apache is running, check Nextcloud's maintenance mode and database connectivity. 5) Validate site responsiveness after each step.
